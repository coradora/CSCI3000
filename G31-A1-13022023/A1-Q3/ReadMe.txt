# Assignment 1 Question 3

## Usage
    This program takes in a positive integer as an argument, and performs a calculation until the value
    is equal to 1. For example, the number 35 will return 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    If multiple arguments are passed, or a negative integer is entered, an error will be returned and the program will exit.

## Compiling the source code

    To compile the source code on Unix/Linux systems, open the terminal to this
    directory and type 
    ```
    gcc ./main.c
    ```
	
## Running the compiled program

    To run the compiled program, open the terminal to this directory and type
    ```
    ./a.out <int>
    ```
    where <int> is any positive integer. 

    The program will then perform calculations on the given number until it is equal to 1,
    printing each step onto the command line/terminal.
